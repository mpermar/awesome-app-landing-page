The place is good bargain for fillies and children.  The rooms were large I  size and well kept.  I am definitely going back with my husband.  U was there on a girls trip.  The restaurant or buffet breakfast was good.  I didn&#x27;t  eat any other meal in the restaurant.  But the beach side bar and grill with karaoke made some delicious burgers."

Room was quiet - we did not hear any slamming doors or screaming kids, just the relaxing ocean waves. The breakfast buffet was everything I expected and reasonable at about $15 with taxes and tip.  Snack bars were reasonably priced for grilled selections. Outside bar was fun with a very personable bartender. We found one really good restaurant (Angelo’s Steak &amp; Pasta) less than a mile away. Great hotel for families with small kids given the indoor and outdoor pools and play areas, bowling alley and arcade."

We will be staying again in the future without a doubt!  The first time we stayed during peak season, this time was off-season.  Both had their perks.  Of course, during peak season, the weather is ideal, but there are more people.  During off season (we went the weekend of December 15th), the weather was cooler, but still warm enough to enjoy a walk on the beach.  Coral Beach has a great indoor pool and hot tubs, so my kids got plenty of swimming and my mother and I relaxed in the hot tubs.  Being off-season, we felt like we almost had the entire beach to ourselves."

The oceanfront bar also had music playing every night and you could sit out on the balcony and listen. It ended promptly at 11 pm each night, which was very considerate for those that have young children. I could also text the concierge for advice on restaurants, more towels needed (which was never an issue) or how much is the breakfast buffet and they were always prompt with a reply."

My complaint is that for the 5 night stay the housekeeping came only twice we had to go look for them to get clean towels and linens. Also I&#x27;m vegetarian and the only option for me was tuna sandwich. I wish if you can put something else on the menu for people like me. Overall we enjoyed our stay at coral beach resort."

Walking distance even for young children to Family Kingdom and the &quot;boardwalk&quot; area, short drive to Broadway at the Beach (and you MUST go there). There was a fun splash pad for younger kids. The pool and lazy river were enough for the 9 yr old. If yiy didn&#x27;t want to get in a car during this vaca, you wouldnt have to with all the food, icecream shops, stores, attractions that are within walking distance (and I mean very close distance). Good amount of onsite parking even if we came back quite late.great security as well. They walk the corridors all day and night."

Lots of things within walking distance, in fact we walked to Food Lion for groceries! Driving to Charleston to tour Patriot&#x27;s Point (USS Yorktown, Laffey and Cragmore) was worth the 2hr trip!"

We don&#x27;t have kids, but it was our favorite pool. We usually planned to go to the kid pool around nap time when there was nobody there. They had these green chairs that sit in the water and a whole &quot;water park&quot; with water buckets, seahorses that shot water, a water mister rainbow, partially sunken pirate ship, etc. It was the warmest water there!3. DJ/Music by the pool: we loved the DJ, Butch Barnes - he made our stay extra special and it was so fun getting to have an interactive music experience. 4. Bartenders: they were always polite and nice and we had great conversations.5. Other guests: the people who stayed here were so friendly! We had plenty of engaging and great conversations. 6. Indoor pools/hot tubs: it was great that the resort offered indoor and outdoor options"

The couch wasn&#x27;t the most comfortable, but the beds were comfy.  I liked the security guards.  Made the place feel safe without being over baring.  Place is perfect for families with children under 12.  Does have some activities that may appeal to teens, but maybe not close enough to grandstand to let young teens go walking to by themselves."

The price range for the food at the grill was $7.00-$10.00. It was really good. We had an ocean view 1 bedroom suite. There were two full beds which slept four. There was a balcony off of the room. And there is a Murphy bed which slept two. There was even a decent sofa for someone to sleep on. The living room also had a balcony. The kitchen was fully stocked. It was just like we were at home. There were silverware, plates, cups, pitcher, pots and pans, ice trays, dishwashing liquid, and full sized refrigerator."

														"The view from our balcony was awesome! I could have sat there listening to the waves the entire  stay. Getting on wifi from a mobile device was easy. There were several indoor heated pools. My kids enjoyed the Roman style spa. The outdoor lazy river and spa were heated. Additional pools and children&#x27;s play area were to cold to get in but were still very clean for the off season. Beach access was easy and the surfboard showers were cute and essential to cleaning sand off your feet.   I liked that to make any purchases you had to use your key card and it charged back to the room so we didn&#x27;t need to carry cash on site. Some seasonal areas weren&#x27;t open (the outdoor bar) except for Saturday night and they closed at 10."

I have a 15,8, and 2 y.o. You have to use your key to access facilities and access doors into hotel. I saw multiple security guards on patrol on hotel grounds. They were also very friendly and helpful, speaking to my girls, holding elevators, asking if they were having fun, etc. All staff were very friendly front desk, housekeeping, even the guest were friendly. The positive energy from the staff must radiate to the guests as well. We had so much fun we decided to stay an extra night. The front desk was very helpful in accommodating us, and we were even able to stay in our room without changing which was nice. I have never filled out a survey for a hotel as they were just ok. I would recommend this hotel to couples or traveling with family. There are enough pools and hot tubs to act like kids and play hard or find a relaxing quiet spot to relax. We will definitely be back."

													<h4>Nice hotel but to much chlorine and confusion between staff</h4>
													<p>
														"The hotel is located directly beside the ocean, and the view to the ocean is beautiful with the ocean front rooms. The buffet breakfast contains a very large selection of foods from fruit to waffles, a variety of breakfast meats, gravy, hash, biscuits, eggs, french toast, grits, cold cereal, and much more (enough to please any family). Guest receive a coupon for half off of bowling (which is needed if you have a large group because you pay for the hour, not per game) There are 10 pools and a few hot tubs so you can always find water for the children and adults to play/relax in. There are 3 bars onsite (2 at all times, 1 closes with the seasons) and the 6th floor bar is very nice. The bar manager is funny and keeps everyone laughing."

													<h4>Nice Clean Hotel, Great Rate Off Season</h4>
													<p>
														"Going in, you must understand that most all high rise hotels up and down Myrtle Beach are really old.  So the ones to find are those that have been refurbished to the best of their abilities, and for me, this seemed to be one on them.  Don&#x27;t expect new and glitzy, cause they are not.  The goal here is fresh and clean and friendly.  You get that here.    The facilities were quite nice....Starbuck s inhouse, arcade and bowling alley for the kids restaurant in house during the season, lots of pools (indoor is all we could use in December).  Cleaning staff VERY nice, and most of desk staff very friendly and helpful.  The room, bathroom and hotel facilities were really clean.  And also the arcade was amazing-   the place I expected to be really gross was very clean and new carpet!  We enjoyed our stay.  And the price was right during low season!"

													<h4>This resort has a great location.</h4>
													<p>
														"This resort has a great location. Fantastic amenities and is well designed. I have stayed here more than once and the staff leaves much to be desired. Particarly the bartenders and the coffee shop staff. The bartenders are rude at best. I don&#x27;t make a comment like that unless the action is repeated. Over the last few years  and multiple visit&#x27;s I can assure you that the staff behind the bar is sub mar almost mean. It was talked about by all the guests as well. So I am not alone. They offer live music which is an amazing attubute. However, they have switched to karaoke this year ( at least during my stay ) every night. It was horrible. Even my kids complained. The outside bar / pool area is a nice place to relax in the evening after dinner and enjoy some music. But not this year. In past visits the tables would be packed with families and couples all enjoying the fresh air and music. I noticed this year that the crowd was minimal. The karaoke needs to go. They had the same musicians that are talented and entertaining on during the day rather than at night and that was a mistake. The gentleman in the breakfast Buffett is kind. ( wish I could recall his name) and the house keeping staff is accommodating and kind as well. For a price, everything you need is on site if you don&#x27;t want to leave the resort and the accommodations are comfortable and easy to navigate."
