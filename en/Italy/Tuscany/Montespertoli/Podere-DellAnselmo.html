We appreciated the daily cleaning as well as the complimentary toiletries in the apartment (shampoo, lotions, toothpaste etc.). The horseback riding available on-site with friendly staff and fair pricing was a highlight of our stay. Air conditioning was much appreciated. Kitchenette in apartment was convenient. We enjoyed having our own large balcony! Location ideal for day trips throughout the region (Florence, Pisa, beaches, San Gimignano, etc). Friendly dog and cats on the property made the place extra-special for our kids."

Pool, cats, dog, horses, vineyards...much to like and enjoy. Our kids loved playing with the cats and dog (and probably fed them too much food from the table). It&#x27;s easy to feel at home."

                                        "Travelled in april with family, stayed for a week. We enjoyed our stay a lot!! Very warm and generous people working there, we really felt at home. The breakfast was good, and the wine and dinner were fantastic. We also enjoyed the easter lunch a lot. The pool area was nice, and there are lots of green spots to relax on. It felt safe to be there with kids. They loved the cats at the hotel and the horseriding just next to the hotel. The guide was so nice and professional. We had a car, and we could easily get to small villages and bigger towns within an hour. You also have a good pizzeria 10 min walk from the hotel. If you like kids clubs, lots of people, free ice cream for the kids, good entertainment and staff always available, take a charter trip instead. This is a place to relax, eat and have a good time together. Would love to visit again!"

													<h4>Great relaxing family holiday.</h4>
													<p>
														"I was staying here with my 4 kids.  We all loved having room to run and play.  The kids favorite was the horseback riding.  We also had a cooking course and of course tasted lots of there excellent wine. We were lucky enough to be there during week that was quite and also on a busy weekend.  It was a great mix.  We enjoyed the family style dinners and meeting new people.   And we also enjoyed a bit of relaxing quiet."

I am cleaners obsessed and the place whilst not a five stars furniture wise is very clean and tidy. They have a party at night which is fun and the kids can run around freely. Pool,  table tennis and lots of green space for children. Fruits and water were available freely all day for us as well. Perfect also not too far from Florence airport about 40 minutes."

													<p>
														"Beautiful place with very nice staff and atmosphere, fantastic food both for breakfast and dinners. Good connections to Florence, Pisa, other cities, close to the highway. We were treated like old friends. The owner of the place was very welcoming and friendly. The apartment we stayed in was in authentic to that region style with nice patio outside and small but convenient kitchen. The pool area as all surroundings were nice with a nice view to the valleys around. The only small thing would have been more comfortable that the pool or part of the pool was a bit more shallow for those with smaller kids it would have been easier to bath. Other than that the place is fantastic!"

Da es 9 Schulpferde gibt und ganz hervorragende Reitlehrerinnen, ideal für den Reiturlaub! Die Gegend ist ein Traum zum Ausreiten. Dauer des Ausrittes kann man selber geplant werden - ob eine, zwei oder X Stunden. Je nach reiterlichem Können ist im Ausritt alles dabei. Alle Gangarten, der Galopp über lange Strecken auch die Hügel hoch! Steile Strecken, durch Wiesen, durch den Fluss...Ein Reitplatz - Kinder dürfen erst ab 14 Jahren ausreiten - ist auch vorhanden! Unsere Tochter war extrem begeistert von Kirstens Unterricht!"
