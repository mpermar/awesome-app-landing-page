Clean facility, great for families and for a romantic getaway, however I would suggest going outside of the summer months for the romantic getaway. Definitely will go back again!"

													<h4>This is the best rated family resort in Myrtle Beach for a reason!</h4>
													<p>
														"Amazing family oriented resort! We traveled during April vacation. Our party consisted of two adults, an 11 year old, and two fifteen year old boys. For the kids: There were two indoor pools with water slides, hot tubs, and a lazy river. For the warm days the outside pool was a blast. For the adults: The view was unbeatable. We were right on the beach, so if we forgot anything it was just a short walk back to the room.  We also chose a room with two bedrooms for privacy- that was the best choice ever!  Within three days of returning home, we are already planning our next years vacation!"

Putt Putt, activities, 2 different buildings with slides and pools. And our view was INCREDIBLE. 14 FLOOR IS WHERE YOU WANT TO STAY."

We have 3 boys 5,11 and 13 and the older boys are used to being careful for younger children.  We had to take our 5 year old out of the indoor lazy river a few times due to older kids running and jumping over him and being ruff.  Their parents were not watching them."

Hotel location was convenient to many nice restaurants, and attractions. The hotel was mostly surrounded by beachfront homes, rather than more hotels, which made the for a much more pleasant view. We will be switching from our previous go-to hotel, to this one in the future."

														"They were quick to respond to our concerns when we called front desk and seemed like they cared about our enjoyment. They were coming out of summer rush and bike week so there was some damage to the property but there were maintenance workers all over the place repairing those things. I liked the beds and pillows. My kids slept on the pull out bed and it was what you would expect from a pull out bed. The view in the oceanfront suites is fantastic, especially for someone who has never stayed on the beach. Our room was older and has seen some wear but you can&#x27;t beat the price we got for 4 nights. We made use of the water park and enjoyed that. The beach is public access and is very very busy during the day but we like going out there in the morning and evening before the general public arrived. (We went to Myrtle Beach state park and Huntington Beach state park to enjoy the wildlife and their beaches.) It&#x27;s away from the busier part of the city which is great for us. I&#x27;m not one for crowds and traffic.  If you need to do laundry they have 2 washers and 4 dryers in the Palms tower. Price was decent too. I have stayed in nicer hotels with only one of each and it was not ideal."

														"Check in time wasnt until four. But we got there at 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning. They allowed us to do early registration, and as soon as our room was ready, at 12 o&#x27;clock, they let us go ahead and check in.  I have four kids and having everything right there and really not even having to leave the hotel to enjoy vacation is absolutely amazing"

Bathroom door bottom was warped and had gold hand on outside and silver on the inside.  Breakfast at the restaurant was one of the best I&#x27;ve seen at area hotels. Ate there 3 or the 4 days there. Lots for kids to do even though we didn&#x27;t bring the grandchildren this time."

Our room - we were 4 adults and 2 kids and we had booked a 2 BR/2BA - it was a wonderful room and grandparents and parents and kids had enough room to move about without bumping into each other.2. The View - was simply spectacular - we could see the beach from our living room and bedroom and it was wonderful to look out into the ocean while cooking and playing games. 3. The kitchen - was excellent. I could not be more happier with the kitchen - we cooked quite a few meals. The kitchen had a  fantastic array of pots, pans, utensils, silveware - so it was a breeze to cook.4. Indoor play area - The indoor pools, water slides and lazy river were enjoyable and both my kinds and my parents had a blast. This was very important to us - to have a back-up plan when it rained outside."

The furniture was old and worn in the living room , not very comfortable. Good for kids, lots of children activities, pools and playground. The lazy river not so great, not very clean and no flow of water? so technically not a real lazy river. The pool towels are small and thin."

													<h4>Dunes Village stay</h4>
													<p>
														"Everything about this hotel was adequate for our one night stay. However, our room was &quot;old&quot; style and the policy to not be able to smoke on property was a bit inconvenient as my husband smokes cigars. I understand not smoking in the room but the balcony would have been more convenient than him having to go clear to the beach to smoke. The hotel was definitely set up more for families and would be a better value for families than a couple on a one night stay. My next visit to Myrtle Beach will definitely not be right where everyone else is staying. More away from the center. However was my first time there so I didn&#x27;t know. I did love the pillows!!"

However, the room was fantastic, no complaints. The weather was awful first day, so we were very thankful for the indoor water park.  The kids couldn&#x27;t get enough of it (ages 5 and 3 year old twins).  They also just loved the pirate ship park right there on the beach.The breakfast is great especially the waffle station.  The front desk staff were pleasant as were the rest of the staff."

													<h4>Must needed vaca for this family with son with autism</h4>
													<p>
														"Everything was great. The nice big balcony, full kitchen, seperate vanity were great. All of the things for the kids to do was amazing and the best part was being oceanfront!!! The staff was amazing, every single worker we came across was great!We dont get a chance to go on vacation often and we were very worried about how it would go. We have a 6 year old son with epilepsy and autism so breaking away from our normal routines can be traumatic for him so we spent a long time preparing him. We were nervous of him getting out of the room or out on balcony and falling. He is a clumber and wanderer as most autistic children are. He did pretty good though. Would be nice to see some sort of child proof locking offered for families with autustic children. Having locks placed up high just means he will climb so we are always on our toes and can not turn our backs for 1 second. Overnight is the tricmiest, to make sure he could not get out while we were asleep meant me not sleeping much but this trip was worth it to us."
