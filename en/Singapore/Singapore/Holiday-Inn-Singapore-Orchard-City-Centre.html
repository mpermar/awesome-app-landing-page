Hotel provides all the guests with one handy phone with FREE facility to make international and local calls with internet facility. Room service is very prompt.Swimming Pool: Separate roof top swimming pools are there for kids and adults with jacuzzy. It was well maintained.Breakfast: Large options are available for all the nationalities. Its better to go early for breakfast as it becomes very busy towards the end time (breakfast is served till 10:30am) and there could be waiting time upto 15mins and more. Small area for kids is available to keep them busy.Location(Orchard Road): Very nice location with lot of shopping and dining options available nearby. Metro(MRT) station is at walkable distance. Well connected with public bus and one stop for Hop In and Hop Off bus service (Yellow Line)."

We appreciate the hotel management for arranging us an early check-in by 10 am to our previously booked room that allowed our kids to have some sleep after night-long journey. Much appreciated the all-time smiling very respectful hotel staffs. Love to come back here again!"

The location was fantastic with Sommerset MRT station a short walk away and Cuppage Terrace restaurants 2 minutes away. This is a strip of 15 restaurants offering a wide selection of food, all accommodating children but also lively. There were also street food style restaurants and coffee shops in the 5 minute stroll to Orchard Rd. We loved it and would definitely return."

Allowed early check in at no cost as we arrived into Singapore after an early and very long trip from Europe.  Our children were sick whilst we were there, and we could not have been helped more  - with extra towels, and bottles of water, the offer to take the buffet breakfast up to the room so the children could lay down.  We also got 20% off our dinner for staying in house.   They also had an in house &quot;mobile phone&quot; that I could call Australia on free of charge. Anything we asked for was provided immediately.  Staff knew what they were doing and didn&#x27;t have to be asked twice, right down to our airport transport.  This will be our hotel in Singapore from here on in."

Arrived from Australia with a 3 yr old at 01:00 am and had to wait 90 minutes to be given a room. Booked 2 premium king but was given a dbl room. Next day was moved to correct room but was $300 out of pocket. Told that a pre authorisation of $50 per room would be taken from credit card but they actually charged me for the double rooms. was told that my luggage would be transfered but my luggage was lost. Asked for some milk for the child but was charged $13 went out in the morning and was told that room would be ready when we returned. Returned at 16:00 and room wasnt ready, had to wait in lobby for 1 hr to be given 1 room . 4 adults with a 3 Yr old !!!After 3 hours finally given additional room. Next day went to dinner after booking but found it was booked out. Retaurant manager was Excellent he offered to pay for our pre dinner drinks at the lounge . Waited in Lounge for 90 minutes and finnally a table was arranged"

There is kids pool that was a good size, as well as a spa pool and a larger lap poolExcellent bar in the lobby that has good atmosphere.  Free newspapers provided everyday in the foyers etc.  Rooms were very clean, modern bathrooms as well.Really easy to catch cabs from the hotel - maximum wait was about 2 minutes on weekdays or weekends."
