The room is huge and comfortable. The pool has variety of depth from kids to professional. The environment is peaceful and calm. The beach is clean and the sea water is clear. I might come here again someday. Thank you for you hospitality."

													<p>
														"i travel with 2 kids, first the concierge service is good, help me bring to my room and take my bags when i check out. upgrade my room free but have to wait for about 30-40 mins due to waiting the room ready. The manager suggest me to have around the hotel and go for the kids playroom, coz he saw me with 2 kids. The swimming pools are awesome. kids pool with water slide, which kids are very excited and can&#x27;t wait to jump in it. Having my dinner and breakfast in the hotel cafe, bed is big for 3 of us, and the bed is comfort. The beach is not meet my expectation, so i not spend much time on it. Overall it is very pleasant to stay in Thistle Port Dickson."

Playrooms were clean and well maintained, lots of other games too, but we didnt have much time to do others. Food was good. Room was just okay for the price, but the bed was veryyyyy comfortable. Beach is so close by, and clean.This is the kind of resort that i would want to come again and again, for the sake of my kids because we really enjoyed our stay here. Maybe in the next few months will repeat our stay here 😀"

													<p>
														"We booked the Garden View room but due to faulty automated door, we were upgraded to Deluxe King seaview room. The garden view room (double)&#x27;s furniture were quite worn out but it was alright. When we were upgraded to Deluxe King seaview, it was amazing as the bed is huge and furnitures definitely look new with nice seaview and swimming pool. Our stay was warmly welcomed by En Zaizul (porter) at the entrance. His smile made our day and he was sharing nice restaurants around Port Dickson with us. When our room&#x27;s door was faulty, he was asked by the front desk to help us. He was really concerned on our toddler as it was bed time and he apologised many times. Whenever we see him around the hotel, he will always flash us with his biggest smile and strike conversation with us if he is free. En Ramlan (security) is also another commendable person in the hotel- sharing with us on good restaurants and places of interest.Breakfast variety is good- ranging from local and Western food. Swimming pool is huge and clean. Playroom is simple but the small balls inside the playroom should be changed as it is not appropriate to use rubberised balls. Beach area is clean and we love hanging out at the beach. Cooling sea breeze and serene surrounding."

														"We loved how kids friendly the hotel was. There were ample of entertainments for the kids. The slide at the pool was definitely a huge hit among the kids. During our stay, the hotel also had hawker styled stalls selling local delights. Prices were very reasonable.  Loved that! Kayak facility was all free of charge. Check in was fast and we also managed to get our rooms early. Check out was also a breeze as we had paid in full."

													<h4>Perfect Getaway For Family and Friends</h4>
													<p>
														"The first thing you would notice about this hotel is the staff, they are friendly, helpful and always smiling. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The breakfast has a very good spread of local and western dishes. The chefs and waiters are super friendly. The whole place is so well planned from the main building which has kids play areas (ball pit, lego room...) to the indoor games (pool, table tennis...) going down to the pools (adults and kids) to the AMAZING gardens (which has a RABBIT PETTING enclosure!!! *great entertainment for kids). The end of the garden is met with the sandy beach which has the watersport division. The guys handling that are super friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable to say the least. They have some very well maintained jet skies and banana boat floats as well as other fun gadgets. The whole experience of staying at this hotel feels so amazing you somehow forget about your home and might get a tear in your eye on your time of departure!"

There is a playroom for kids to play in! A great stop before bedtime.  We also discovered the game arcade on our last day."

													<h4>Great gateway with family</h4>
													<p>
														"This is my first experience with Thistle and I would say kudos to thewhole team who were smiling and trying to provide the best they couldbe, from the moment I arrived at lobby till I check out.when checking in, i was offered room upgrade to suite and i accept it as it was my wedding anniversary! The room, was good, but the furniture a bit outdated and i don&#x27;t mind as i stayed for a day and i got comfortable bed with Pool, garden and sea view.Bathroom fitting need to be upgraded as i find hard time to set the right temperature.Cleanliness can be improved(take time to clean - not to hurry), Yard was good as well but a small setback,there was workers who were cutting the grass and small rocks were thrown on the Yard. we had to clean it as my kids were running outside and in.I had power trip in my room and i takes more than 3 hours to resolve as the aircond compressor were damaged and needed to be replace. i went to lobby to discuss on the issue and i met this duty manager-Ms yanti, the SUPERWOMAN.what i like about her is, she acknowledge the problem, radio contact to the technical team to check on the issue, followed to the room and climb the ladder to see herself on the issues, stayed there with the technical team, get thing fixed permanently.To compensate on hours wasted, she offered late check out and refund for the room upgrade fees. I really overwhelmed and i refused to accept refund instead i stay till 5pm and check out. Thank you again to the SUPERWOMAN - Ms Yanti and technical crew  Jeeva and &amp; team, and also all friendly receptionist and porters for the great hospitality.i will go back again......"

														"I liked the ambience of the hotel interior and the beach was clean! I was rather disappointed that I opted for a queen sized bed and bath tub but was given a double single beds and no tub hence they should inform us early. Great location and nice pool for kids with water slides! Room service was also excellent!"
